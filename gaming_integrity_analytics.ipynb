    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project studies the behaviors of players in a massive multiplayer online game, focusing on the dynamics of cheating, specifically how cheaters associate with each other and how interactions with cheaters influence others to adopt similar behavior. The goal is to implement a Python program that simulates alternative scenarios to test these hypotheses, comparing actual player behaviors to randomized outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the task, only basic Python data types and core libraries to ensure mastery of fundamental programming concepts were used, to emphasize the application of basic Python principles. The program was designed with future adaptability in mind."
